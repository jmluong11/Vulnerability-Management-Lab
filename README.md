<h1>Vulnerability Management Lab</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<b>The purpose of this lab is to understand, manipulate, and manage a virtual machine that contains possible vulnerabilities on its system and the software that's installed. This lab helps get a better experience on how Nessus, which is a vulnerability scanner, works by prioritizing what vulnerabilities need to be updated/fixed first as well as the solutions that are provided. It's important to constantly check for vulnerabilies for multiple systems in a company to ensure software/computers are up to date and are less likely for hackers to exploit any possible weaknesses, enough that the risk is low or to an acceptable level. <br>

<h2>Utilities Used and Skills Learned</h2>

- <b>Nessus Essentials</b>
- <b>Virtualization (Oracle Virtual Box)</b>
- <b>Windows 10 ISO</b>
- <b>Vulnerability Remediation</b>

- <b>Gather the IPv4 address by going to the command line and entering "ipconfig"<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hzUZTy5.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q6wASP6.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>Follow the next 3 images above to turn off the firewall for the virtual machine and ensure "off" is selected for all three tabs (Domain Profile, Private Profile, and Public Profile).<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TtiLzKT.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>On your personal computer with the command line, ping the IPv4 address from the virtual machine to ensure it can be connected for Nessus Essentials.<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zbfg8L0.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/G8wDFyY.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>In the next 2 images above, we are going to begin a basic vulnerability scan through Nessus.<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aLmyMhx.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>Enter any name for the scan and copy the IPv4 address from the virtual machine and paste it into "Targets"<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GMOcGSY.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>Begin the scan which will take several minutes<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ulbUQZH.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>The scan quantitates the amount of vulnerabilities discovered throughout the scan and ranks them on how critical of a vulnerability it is for the system.<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2mYzsQZ.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>By clicking on the scan, it lists the general topic of each vulnerability that was identified or it will list items to inform the user to be aware of as a precaution.<br>
  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/91SAgpt.png" height="80%" width="100%"/>
- <b>Looking more specifically, it gives a description of the vulnerability and possible solutions to remediate this vulnerability.<br>

<h3>Authenticating Scans and Providing Credentials for Nessus</h3>
-<b>Follow the next images below to set up the virtual machine to receive authenticating scans. Authenticating scans is necessary because Nessus cannot scan specific vulnerabilities</b>
